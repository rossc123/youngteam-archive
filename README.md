# YoungTeam-Archive

## General info
Growing up in Scotland I was surrounded by Young Team (Scottish youth gang) culture. <br>
Many of these young teams created simple but unique websites to  promote themselves.<br>
Although young team culture is no longer prevalent you can still find dormant young team websites scattered thoughout the internet.<br>
I created the Young Team Archive to collate as many of these dormant sites as I could find and to celebrate Scottish youth culture.<br>
I am not a fan of Web3 and hope people see these user owned and created sites as an alternative to the social media platforms offered by big tech.<br>

## Technologies
This project was created with:
* HMTL5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* Google Sheets
* jQuery
* Papa Parse

I am very pleased with the design of this project, the webiste is scalable whilst also only requiring a small amount of code.<br>
This is achieved through the use of Google Sheets in conjuction with the Papa Parse JavaScript library.<br>
The information for each webiste is stored in a Google Sheets spreadsheet, within Google Sheets this spreadhseet is then converted to a CSV file.<br>
The CSV file is then handed to PapaParse where CSV entries are parsed into the containers you can see on the webpage.<br>
These containers are dynamically loaded though the use of jQuery.<br>
The content scaling and layout is handled by though using Flexbox in CSS.<br>
