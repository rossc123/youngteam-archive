# youngteam-archive

## General info
Growing up in Scotland I was surrounded by Young Team (Scottish youth gang) culture.
Many of these young teams created simple but unique websites to  promote themselves.
Although young team culture is no longer prevalent you can still find dormant young team websites scattered thoughout the internet.
I created the Young Team Archive to collate as many of these dormant sites as I could find and to celebrate Scottish youth culture.
I am not a fan of the Web3 and hope people see these user owned and created sites as an alternative to the social media platforms offered by big tech.

## Technologies
This porject was created with:
* HMTL5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* Google Sheets
* jQuery
* Papa Parse

I am very pleased with the design of this project, the webiste is scalable whilst also only requiring a small amount of code.
This is achieved through the use of Google Sheets in conjuction with the Papa Parse JavaScript library.
The information for each webiste is stored in a Google Sheets spreadsheet, within Google Sheets this spreadhseet is then converted to a CSV file.
The CSV file is then handed to PapaParse where CSV entries are parsed into the containers you can see on the webpage.
These containers are dynamically loaded though the use of jQuery.
The content scaling and layout is handled by though using Flexbox in CSS.
